# BlackSheep
Second project for Objective Programming class, second semester on Gda≈Ñsk University of Technology
# Infos
This is basically https://github.com/szycikm/Sheep but this time in Java and with GUI. I didn't come up with this :D

Also please note this is my first Java project, so I might do some stupid mistakes. You have been warned.

# Observations
I didn't have many problems with the GUI for this project. I think that's because of my experience with Windows Forms in c#. Of course there's a lot of differences between Swing and Windows Forms - just as many as between java and c#. That being said, those two platforms are similar in many ways. This helped me quite a bit - I just needed to find equivalents of Forms controls that I already knew.
